# Hourly stateful incremental PyTorch build (prebuilt viable/strict).
#
# Runs on the dedicated always-on build node (NodeType=build, m7i.48xlarge,
# 192 vCPU / 768 GB). Produces an importable, incrementally-buildable torch tree
# that dev pods reflink-copy into /home/dev/pytorch on claim — so users "import
# torch" instantly and rebuild their PR diff in seconds, not ~20 min.
#
# Recipe is empirically validated (see CLAUDE.md): CUDA 13.2 (matches the cu13
# nvshmem ABI bundled in the image), TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="9.0;10.0" (plain —
# cmake auto-adds sm_90a/sm_100a to the cutlass kernels, exactly like trunk CI;
# covers H100 + B200), BUILD_TEST=0 (like CI), ccache on the shared EFS.
#
# Build queue: concurrencyPolicy=Forbid (k8s skips a tick if one is still
# running) + a flock on the shared EFS (belt-and-suspenders against the 3-way
# build collision we hit during bring-up).
#
# Persistence:
#   - The checkout + build/ ninja dir live on the build node's local disk via a
#     hostPath mounted AT /home/dev/pytorch. build/'s CMakeCache bakes absolute
#     paths, so we MUST build at the same path pods use (/home/dev/pytorch) for
#     the in-pod incremental to work. The hostPath survives across hourly runs
#     (node is always-on) → every run is incremental.
#   - ccache lives on the shared ccache EFS (/ccache_shared) — survives node
#     replacement, and is the SAME cache every dev pod uses, so a user's own
#     rebuild benefits from the build node's compiles and vice-versa.
#
# Publish: rsync the built tree to /ccache_shared/prebuilt/pytorch-<arch>/ on the
# shared EFS (only changed objects move each hour). The pytorch-snapshot
# DaemonSet picks it up from there onto each node's NVMe.
